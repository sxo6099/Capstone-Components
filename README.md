# Capstone-Components
Scripts written for the completion of my Master's Capstone Project.
The first, wireshark_to_suricata.py is a tool that can convert .pcap files into suricata alert .log and .json files, running the inputted data against the EToR ruleset.
The second, suricata_stats.py, takes in suricata alert .log and .json files to produce statistic and visualizations based on the data examined; both 3-dimensional scatterplots and radar charts.
The system diagram included shows a high-level overview on the flow of data through the project and the additional components that could be added for further extension of work.
