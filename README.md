# Capstone-Components
Scripts written for the completion of my Master's Capstone Project.
The first, wireshark_to_suricata.py is a tool that can convert .pcap files into suricata alert .log and .json files.
The second, suricata_stats.py, takes in suricata alert .log and .json files to produce statistic and visualizations based on the data examined.
